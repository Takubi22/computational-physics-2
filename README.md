# Computational Physics II

## Yachay Tech University - 2026

## About this repository:
This is a collection of lecture notes and programming exercises carried out as part of the Computational Physics 2 course at Yachay Tech University.

## Lecturer:
Wladimir E. Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This is an advanced course on object-oriented programming for physics. It is the second module of the computational physics series taught at Yachay Tech. The course focuses on introducing advanced numerical methods and simulation techniques used in physics, and provides an overview of recent progress made in several areas of scientific computing. The course includes detailed step-by-step examples of how to design software and use parallel programming to solve problems in physics. Topics range from advanced data analysis, through ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamics and chaos, to basic thermodynamic and fluid simulations. Each section of the course includes practical examples on different areas of science and technology in which computational physics and high-performance computing have played a major role in the recent years.

### Prerequisites:

Ideally, to take this class, you should have already taken and approved Computational Physics 1.

## Evaluation:

Evaluation has 4 components, with weights distributed as follows:

**1. Formative Evaluation (2 Homework):** 20%

**2. Laboratory (at least 4 Quizzes):** 20%

**3. 1 Midterm Exam:** 30%

**4. 1 Final Exam:** 30%

These components consist of the following tasks:

- Homework include long application problems.

- Classwork are quizzes with two components: one is carried out in class, one is carried out at home.

- Both the midterm and final exams have two components, one is carried out in class, one is carried out at home.


## Weekly tutoring schedule:

If you have questions on the material, you can find me in the office:

- On Tuesdays: 

- On Thursdays:  

## Class attendance:

- As per regulations of the Vicerrector's office of Yachay Tech, you should attend 70% of the classes to pass the course.
  
- To justify an absence, please submit all the necessary official documentation within 5 days.

## On academic integrity:

- Students are responsible for ensuring the academic integrity of their submitted assignments and exams.

- Cheating in exams, plagiarising, and copying code or solutions from other students, from previous years' solutions, and/or from Internet sources are all breaches of academic integrity.
  
- The above includes copying code from AI chatbots (which are neither designed nor optimised for physics and programming), e.g. copying and pasting code from chatGPT infringes academic integrity.

- Academic misconduct will be penalised according to our University’s regulations.

## Late assignment policy:

Late assignments accompanied by appropriate justification (e.g. a medical certificate, etc.) will receive no penalisation. Late assignments without appropriate justification will receive a penalisation of -1% per late hour.
